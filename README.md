# Vicsek Model Numerical Simulation

This repository contains code for numerical simulation of the Vicsek model. 
The main objective of this project is to solve the Vicsek model numerically 
and visualize its behavior when the values of the control parameter eta are varied.

## Vicsek Model Overview

The Vicsek model is a widely studied system in statistical physics and complex systems. 
It is a simple yet powerful model used to understand the collective behavior of self-propelled particles, 
such as a flock of birds, a school of fish, or a colony of bacteria. 
In this model, particles move at a constant speed and adjust their orientation to match the average direction of their neighbors within a certain radius.
For more information, see other references.

The main parameters of the Vicsek model are as follows
- N: Number of particles.
- L: Size of the simulation box.
- R: Radius of interaction of the particles with each other.
- v0: Constant velocity of the particles.
- eta: The magnitude of the noise when determining the direction.

## Results

GIF and PNG files are available in the `data` folder to illustrate the behavior of the Vicsek model for varying values of eta.

### GIFファイル

1. [low_eta](data/eta=0.1.gif)- Illustrates the behavior at a high eta value, where particles exhibit collective motion and alignment.
2. [high_eta](data/eta=1.0.gif) - Shows the behavior of particles at a low eta value, where they move independently without significant alignment.

### PNG Files

[phase_transition](data/PhaseTransiton.png) - This PNG file demonstrates the phase transition in the Vicsek model.
As eta is increased, the system transitions from a ordered state to an disordered  state.
